## Motivation, Background, and Setup


### Gravity Waves Parametrization

### Quasi-Biennual Oscillation
Our project is located in a very interesting fact in Atomespheric Fluid Dynamics called Quasi-Biennual Oscillation, QBO for short.


### QBO-1d


### Physical Parametrization with Stochasticity


### Goals: Online and Offline





## Methodology
Despite human beings' great breakthrough on classification, regression is still a hard task. Here is the list of all the machine learning algorithms for regression that I can think of:

* Linear regression
* Neural Nets
* Regression trees/Forest
* Supported Vector Machine

Linear models will by no means be used in practice, we will treat it as a baseline. Neural nets and trees and forest have been done by other members in the group. Therefore, our main focus is the application of supported vector machine for regression(SVR for short) on our problem.

For an introduction of supporetd vector machine and regression, please refer to my presentation slides and weekly report.


## Results

### Offline Results
With some highly nontrivial data preprocessing and hyperparameters tuning, SVR model are able to achieve a fairly satisfactory performance on the dataset ($R^{2} = 0.95$), which is much better than the linear models ($R^{2} = 0.88$)

### Online Results
With some highly nontrivial hyper-parameters tuning, SVR models can successfully emulate the physical-based gravity waves, thus producing the correct oscillation.

Unfortunately, the efficiency of SVR models are not satisfactory compared with pre-existing NN models (which is very conter-intuitive). Its low efficiency is mainly due to the computation of exponential function inside the kernel.

Also, it has some ability to 'generalize'. For the definition of generalization and further details, please refer to my presentation slides.
